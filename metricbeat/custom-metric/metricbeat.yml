# Config reloading allows to dynamically load modules. Each file which is
# monitored must contain one or multiple modules as a list.

  # Period on which files under path should be checked for changes
  reload.period: 10s

  # Set to true to enable config reloading

# Maximum amount of time to randomly delay the start of a metricset. Use 0 to
# disable startup delay.
